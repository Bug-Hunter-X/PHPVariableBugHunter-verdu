This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP involving variable variables and recursive functions.  The `processData` function processes an array, replacing strings starting with '@' with the values of dynamically named variables.  However, the recursive nature and the use of variable variables can lead to unexpected results or errors if not handled carefully.  The solution provided illustrates a safer approach.
